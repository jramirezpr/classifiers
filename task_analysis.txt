Analysis

To rank the sensors according to predictive power I first define which is the
best sensor.
The best sensor is the one that you would choose if you could only choose access
to the data of one sensor. The next-best sensor would be the one that
you would choose if you couldn't choose the best sensor.
In general ,the k-th sensor in the ranking would be the one that I would
choose if I couldn't choose any of the 0...k-1 best sensors.
To do prediction using sensor_i ,we would apply some classifier method to the data (sensor_i, class_label).
Of course, in order to know how I would use the chosen sensor for prediction,
it is best to do some exploratory analysis. 
First, it is useful to see that both class labels have 200 elements 
(equally-sized classes).
Next, What I do is I split each sensor feature into 10 different bins of equal width,
and see what is the amount elements of class 1 in bin_i as a proportion of the total amount of elements
in bin_i. This gives me the bar charts in the figure. Intuitively, the best sensors are the ones were
each bar is far away from 0.5 (random classifier), or put in another way, the ones were each bar is either
close to 1 or close to 0. In fact, these bar charts could be seen as a crude classifier, where
to predict a new element x we would figure out which bin bin_i to put it in, and the predicted class would be
2*(round(proportion(bin_i)))-1.
This crude classifier actually inspired my approach using k-neighbors classifier: for a point p, create a "bin"
made up of the k closest nearest neighbors from the provided data, and they vote according to which class they belong
in the data.
